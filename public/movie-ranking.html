<h1>David's Greatest Movies</h1>

<h2>3 Movies I Resonated With</h2> 
<hr />

<h3>The Boy and the Beast</h3>
<p>The film speaks to me as a child who didn't find joy and fondness in normal children activities,<br />
and I also didn't have my parents around and sought parenthood from strangers. <br />
I developed my martial arts from a stranger as well and he grew to be like a father to me.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>The film speaks of love and shows how to love people for their<br />
partners and accepting them for who they are. In many ways it shows that <br />
love can flourish even through time.</p>

<h3>American History X</h3>
<p>The movie speaks of the cycle of hatred and how it will only continue to feed itself<br />
as long as we give into our rage. The film does depict a racist, but he is someone<br />
who has taken the time to self reflect upon his character. Not for himself but for his brother.</p>
