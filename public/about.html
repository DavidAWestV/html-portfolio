<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is David West V, and I'm overwhelming new to the world of coding. I didn't have much support growing up,
  but I'm lucky enough to have had friends to point me in the right direction and guide me here. I served in the military 
  for a few years as a dental tech, but I'm 6'3 so its a lot more uncomfortable than many would imagine being a dental sentence.
</p>

<p>I have many children who are usually attached to my hip, and honestly its one of my faborite things in the world. I have been taking
this time to evolve myself after my divorce, and I've found an assortment of hobbies. I do Bjj and Judo in my spare time and I have a knack
for it. I can honestly say I love it more than I should at times.
